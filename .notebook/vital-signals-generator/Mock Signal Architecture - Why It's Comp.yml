Mock Signal Architecture - Why It's Complex

  The sophisticated part:
  - Stateful drift: Vitals trend over time (e.g., BP slowly rising)
  - Correlated vitals: If HR goes up, BP should correlate
  - Crisis injection: Realistic medical emergencies with proper progression
  - Multiple patients: Each with different baseline patterns
  - Background service coordination: Generate → Save to DB → Broadcast via SignalR
